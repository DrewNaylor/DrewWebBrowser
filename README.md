# DrewWebBrowser
A lightweight web browser I'm working on based on the VB.Net Windows Forms WebBrowser control.

TODO:

- [ ] Make tabs work properly.
 - [x] Add Tab works.
 - [ ] Remove Tab does not work.
- [ ] Update titlebar with page title.
- [ ] Update statusbar with current status text.

And more.
